      Re-verified against current code in the post-monorepo sweep: every checkable claim on this
      card was found true as written, so nothing changed but the baseline. Bound code was read at
      this sha; the framework suite is green at 1871 tests.

Source binding for the template parser. Behavioral intent stays on the owning component card, COMPONENT-TEMPLATE-PARSER in the connected `puzzle` plan (`repo=puzzle`); this card anchors that contract to `packages/puzzle-lang/parser/parser.go` (the Puzzle language module, D172; `path` is relative to this plan root, `packages/puzzle-lang`).

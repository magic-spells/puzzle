      Baseline re-stamped after the monorepo move (290e4b7) relocated the framework to
      packages/puzzle. Every bound file is byte-identical between the prior verified_sha and this
      one — the path moved, the code did not. No content was re-checked, and none needed to be.

Source binding for the owning component card. Behavioral intent stays in the connected component ([[COMPONENT-SSG]]); this card anchors that plan to `client-runtime/ssg/assemble.js`. The single source of chain assembly for both the build-time prerenderer and the browser `mountStatic` kernel ([[DECISION-D81-STATIC-PAGES-MODE]]), so a prerendered page and its client render cannot diverge.
